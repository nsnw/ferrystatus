# ferrystatus
User-friendly view of the status of BC Ferries sailings

This code will not run straight out of the box...

What this does:-

* scrapes the BC Ferries website for sailing statuses
* stores the results
* displays them in a nice, easy to read format

You can see this in action at https://ferrystatus.nsnw.ca/, although it may well be broken at any point.
